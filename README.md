# Why?

TED is an incredible organization that has brought stunning stories about the human race, its evolution, its advancements and challenges to the masses. I want to help spread these stories among stories with the help of Machine Learning.

With about 2500 (at the time of this writing) talks, TED has recorded over an incredible 34500 minutes (give or take), which is 24 days of listening/viewing.

[Note - TEDx ~ 40,000 mins, TEDEd ~ 9500 mins]


Unlike A/V files, text has few advantages:
- Reading is faster than listening.
- We can search text to find patterns, and then use those results to find more info.
- We are way better technologically at organizing and extracting nuggets from text than from A/V.

What is more interesting to me is how this can help not only in spreading the word, but interesting story telling products on top of this data.

There are a lot of things we can do with it.
