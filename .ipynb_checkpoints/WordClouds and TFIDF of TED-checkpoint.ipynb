       "'\\nYou&#39;ve heard of your I.Q.,\\nyour general intelligence,\\nbut what&#39;s your Psy-Q?\\nHow much do you know\\nabout what makes you tick,\\nand how good are you\\nat predicting other people&#39;s behavior\\nor even your own?\\nAnd how much of what you think you know\\nabout psychology is wrong?\\nLet&#39;s find out by counting down\\nthe top 10 myths of psychology.\\nYou&#39;ve probably heard it said\\nthat when it comes to their psychology,\\nit&#39;s almost as if men are from Mars\\nand women are from Venus.\\nBut how different\\nare men and women really?\\nTo find out, let&#39;s start\\nby looking at something\\non which men and women really do differ\\nand plotting some psychological\\ngender differences on the same scale.\\nOne thing men and women\\ndo really differ on\\nis how far they can throw a ball.\\nSo if we look at the data for men here,\\nwe see what is called\\na normal distribution curve.\\nA few men can throw a ball really far,\\nand a few men not far at all,\\nbut most a kind of average distance.\\nAnd women share\\nthe same distribution as well,\\nbut actually there&#39;s\\nquite a big difference.\\nIn fact, the average man\\ncan throw a ball further\\nthan about 98 percent of all women.\\nSo now let&#39;s look at what\\nsome psychological gender differences\\nlook like on the same standardized scale.\\nAny psychologist will tell you\\nthat men are better\\nat spatial awareness than women --\\nso things like map-reading, \\nfor example -- and it&#39;s true,\\nbut let&#39;s have a look\\nat the size of this difference.\\nIt&#39;s tiny; the lines are so close\\ntogether they almost overlap.\\nIn fact, the average woman is better\\nthan 33 percent of all men,\\nand of course, if that was 50 percent,\\nthen the two genders\\nwould be exactly equal.\\nIt&#39;s worth bearing in mind that this\\ndifference and the next one I&#39;ll show you\\nare pretty much the biggest\\npsychological gender differences\\never discovered in psychology.\\nSo here&#39;s the next one.\\nAny psychologist will tell you\\nthat women are better\\nwith language and grammar than men.\\nSo here&#39;s performance\\non the standardized grammar test.\\nThere go the women. There go the men.\\nAgain, yes, women are better on average,\\nbut the lines are so close\\nthat 33 percent of men\\nare better than the average woman,\\nand again, if it was 50 percent,\\nthat would represent\\ncomplete gender equality.\\nSo it&#39;s not really\\na case of Mars and Venus.\\nIt&#39;s more a case of, if anything,\\n\\nMars and Snickers:\\nbasically the same, but one&#39;s maybe \\nslightly nuttier than the other.\\nI won&#39;t say which.\\nNow we&#39;ve got you warmed up.\\nLet&#39;s psychoanalyze you using\\nthe famous Rorschach inkblot test.\\nSo you can probably see two, I dunno,\\ntwo bears or two people or something.\\nBut what do you think they&#39;re doing?\\nPut your hand up if you think\\nthey&#39;re saying hello.\\nNot many people. Okay.\\nPut your hands up if you think\\nthey are high-fiving.\\nOkay. What if you think they&#39;re fighting?\\nOnly a few people there.\\nOkay, so if you think they&#39;re\\nsaying hello or high-fiving,\\nthen that means you&#39;re a friendly person.\\nIf you think they&#39;re fighting,\\nyou&#39;re a bit more of a \\nnasty, aggressive person.\\nAre you a lover or a fighter, basically.\\nWhat about this one?\\nThis isn&#39;t really a voting one, so on \\nthree everyone shout out what you see.\\nOne, two, three.\\n(Audience shouting)\\nI heard hamster. Who said hamster?\\nThat was very worrying.\\nA guy there said hamster.\\nWell, you should see\\nsome kind of two-legged animal here,\\nand then the mirror image of them there.\\nIf you didn&#39;t, then this means\\nthat you have difficulty\\nprocessing complex situations\\nwhere there&#39;s a lot going on.\\nExcept, of course,\\nit doesn&#39;t mean that at all.\\nRorschach inkblot tests\\nhave basically no validity\\nwhen it comes to diagnosing\\npeople&#39;s personality\\nand are not used\\nby modern-day psychologists.\\nIn fact, one recent study found\\nthat when you do try\\nto diagnose people&#39;s personalities\\nusing Rorschach inkblot tests,\\nschizophrenia was diagnosed\\nin about one sixth of apparently\\nperfectly normal participants.\\nSo if you didn&#39;t do that well on this,\\nmaybe you are not\\na very visual type of person.\\nSo let&#39;s do another\\nquick quiz to find out.\\nWhen making a cake, do you prefer to --\\nso hands up for each one again --\\ndo you prefer to use\\na recipe book with pictures?\\nYeah, a few people.\\nHave a friend talk you through?\\nOr have a go, making it up\\nas you go along?\\nQuite a few people there.\\nOkay, so if you said A,\\nthen this means that you\\nare a visual learner\\nand you learn best when information\\nis presented in a visual style.\\nIf you said B, it means\\nyou&#39;re an auditory learner,\\nthat you learn best when information\\nis presented to you in an auditory format.\\nAnd if you said C, it means\\nthat you&#39;re a kinesthetic learner,\\nthat you learn best when you get stuck in\\nand do things with your hands.\\nExcept, of course,\\nas you&#39;ve probably guessed,\\nthat it doesn&#39;t, because\\nthe whole thing is a complete myth.\\nLearning styles are made up and are \\nnot supported by scientific evidence.\\nSo we know this because in\\ntightly controlled experimental studies,\\nwhen learners are given material to learn\\neither in their preferred style\\nor an opposite style,\\nit makes no difference at all to the\\namount of information that they retain.\\nAnd if you think about it\\nfor just a second,\\nit&#39;s just obvious\\nthat this has to be true.\\nIt&#39;s obvious that\\nthe best presentation format\\ndepends not on you,\\nbut on what you&#39;re trying to learn.\\nCould you learn to drive a car,\\nfor example,\\njust by listening to someone\\ntelling you what to do\\nwith no kinesthetic experience?\\nCould you solve simultaneous equations\\nby talking them through in your head\\nand without writing them down?\\nCould you revise \\nfor your architecture exams\\nusing interpretive dance\\nif you&#39;re a kinesthetic learner?\\nNo. What you need to do \\nis match the material to be learned\\nto the presentation format, not you.\\nI know many of you are A-level students\\nthat will have recently gotten\\nyour GCSE results.\\nAnd if you didn&#39;t quite get\\nwhat you were hoping for,\\nthen you can&#39;t really blame\\nyour learning style,\\nbut one thing that you might want\\nto think about blaming is your genes.\\nSo what this is all about is a\\nrecent study at University College London\\nfound that 58 percent of the variation\\nbetween different students\\nand their GCSE results\\nwas down to genetic factors.\\nThat sounds like a very precise figure,\\nso how can we tell?\\nWell, when we want to unpack\\nthe relative contributions\\nof genes and the environment,\\nwhat we can do is do a twin study.\\nSo identical twins share\\n100 percent of their environment\\nand 100 percent of their genes,\\nwhereas non-identical twins\\nshare 100 percent of their environment,\\nbut just like any brother and sister,\\nshare only 50 percent of their genes.\\nSo by comparing how similar\\nGCSE results are in identical twins\\nversus non-identical twins,\\nand doing some clever math,\\nwe can an idea of how much variation\\nand performance is due to the environment\\nand how much is due to genes.\\nAnd it turns out that it&#39;s\\nabout 58 percent due to genes.\\nSo this isn&#39;t to undermine the hard work\\nthat you and your teachers here put in.\\nIf you didn&#39;t quite get the GCSE results\\nthat you were hoping for,\\nthen you can always try blaming\\nyour parents, or at least their genes.\\nOne thing that you shouldn&#39;t blame\\nis being a left-brained\\nor right-brained learner,\\nbecause again, this is a myth.\\nSo the myth here is that\\nthe left brain is logical,\\nit&#39;s good with equations like this,\\nand the right brain is more creative,\\nso the right brain is better at music.\\nBut again, this is a myth\\nbecause nearly everything that you do\\ninvolves nearly all parts\\nof your brain talking together,\\neven just the most mundane thing\\nlike having a normal conversation.\\nHowever, perhaps one reason\\nwhy this myth has survived\\nis that there is\\na slight grain of truth to it.\\nSo a related version of the myth\\nis that left-handed people are\\nmore creative than right-handed people,\\nwhich kind of makes sense because\\nyour brain controls the opposite hands,\\nso left-handed people,\\nthe right side of the brain\\nis slightly more active\\nthan the left-hand side of the brain,\\nand the idea is the right-hand side\\nis more creative.\\nNow, it isn&#39;t true per se\\nthat left-handed people are more creative\\nthan right-handed people.\\nWhat is true that ambidextrous people,\\nor people who use both hands\\nfor different tasks,\\nare more creative thinkers\\nthan one-handed people,\\nbecause being ambidextrous involves\\nhaving both sides of the brain\\ntalk to each other a lot,\\nwhich seems to be involved\\nin creating flexible thinking.\\nThe myth of the creative left-hander\\narises from the fact\\nthat being ambidextrous\\nis more common amongst \\nleft-handers than right-handers,\\nso a grain of truth in the idea\\nof the creative left-hander,\\nbut not much.\\nA related myth that you&#39;ve\\nprobably heard of\\nis that we only use\\n10 percent of our brains.\\nThis is, again, a complete myth.\\nNearly everything that we do,\\neven the most mundane thing,\\nuses nearly all of our brains.\\nThat said, it is of course true\\nthat most of us don&#39;t use our brainpower\\nquite as well as we could.\\nSo what could we do\\nto boost our brainpower?\\nMaybe we could listen\\nto a nice bit of Mozart.\\nHave you heard of the idea\\nof the Mozart effect?\\nSo the idea is that listening \\nto Mozart makes you smarter\\nand improves your \\nperformance on I.Q. tests.\\nNow again, what&#39;s interesting\\nabout this myth\\nis that although it&#39;s basically a myth,\\nthere is a grain of truth to it.\\nSo the original study found that\\nparticipants who were played\\nMozart music for a few minutes\\ndid better on a subsequent I.Q. test\\nthan participants who simply\\nsat in silence.\\nBut a follow-up study recruited\\nsome people who liked Mozart music\\nand then another group of people\\nwho were fans of \\nthe horror stories of Stephen King.\\nAnd they played the people\\nthe music or the stories.\\nThe people who preferred\\nMozart music to the stories\\ngot a bigger I.Q. boost\\nfrom the Mozart than the stories,\\nbut the people who preferred\\nthe stories to the Mozart music\\ngot a bigger I.Q. boost\\nfrom listening to the Stephen King stories\\nthan the Mozart music.\\nSo the truth is that listening\\nto something that you enjoy\\nperks you up a bit\\nand gives you a temporary I.Q. boost\\non a narrow range of tasks.\\nThere&#39;s no suggestion that\\nlistening to Mozart,\\nor indeed Stephen King stories,\\nis going to make you any smarter\\nin the long run.\\nAnother version of the Mozart myth\\nis that listening to Mozart can make you\\nnot only cleverer but healthier, too.\\nUnfortunately, this doesn&#39;t\\nseem to be true\\nof someone who listened\\nto the music of Mozart almost every day,\\nMozart himself,\\nwho suffered from gonorrhea,\\nsmallpox, arthritis,\\nand, what most people think eventually\\nkilled him in the end, syphilis.\\nThis suggests that Mozart\\nshould have bit more careful, perhaps,\\nwhen choosing his sexual partners.\\nBut how do we choose a partner?\\nSo a myth that I have to say\\nis sometimes spread a bit by sociologists\\nis that our preferences in a romantic \\npartner are a product of our culture,\\nthat they&#39;re very culturally specific.\\nBut in fact, the data don&#39;t back this up.\\nA famous study surveyed people from\\n[37] different cultures across the globe,\\nfrom Americans to Zulus,\\non what they look for in a partner.\\nAnd in every single culture\\nacross the globe,\\nmen placed more value\\non physical attractiveness in a partner\\nthan did women,\\nand in every single culture, too,\\nwomen placed more importance than did men\\non ambition and high earning power.\\nIn every culture, too,\\nmen preferred women\\nwho were younger than themselves,\\nan average of, I think it was 2.66 years,\\nand in every culture, too,\\nwomen preferred men\\nwho were older than them,\\nso an average of 3.42 years,\\nwhich is why we&#39;ve got here\\n&quot;Everybody needs a Sugar Daddy.&quot;\\nSo moving on from trying\\nto score with a partner\\nto trying to score in basketball\\nor football or whatever your sport is.\\nThe myth here is that sportsmen go through\\nhot-hand streaks, Americans call them,\\nor purple patches,\\nwe sometimes say in England,\\nwhere they just can&#39;t miss,\\nlike this guy here.\\nBut in fact, what happens is that\\nif you analyze the pattern\\nof hits and misses statistically,\\nit turns out that it&#39;s\\nnearly always at random.\\nYour brain creates patterns\\nfrom the randomness.\\nIf you toss a coin,\\na streak of heads or tails is going \\nto come out somewhere in the randomness,\\nand because the brain likes to see\\npatterns where there are none,\\nwe look at these streaks\\nand attribute meanings to them\\nand say, &quot;Yeah he&#39;s really on form today,&quot;\\nwhereas actually you would\\nget the same pattern\\nif you were just getting\\nhits and misses at random.\\nSo an exception to this, however,\\nis penalty shootouts.\\nA recent study looking\\nat penalty shootouts in football\\nshows that players who represent countries\\nwith a very bad record\\nin penalty shootouts,\\nlike, for example, England,\\ntend to be quicker to take their shots\\nthan countries with a better record,\\nand presumably as a result,\\nthey&#39;re more likely to miss.\\nWhich raises the question\\nof if there&#39;s any way that we\\ncould improve people&#39;s performance.\\nAnd one thing you might think about doing\\nis punishing people for their misses\\nand seeing if that improves them.\\nThis idea, the effect that punishment\\ncan improve performance,\\nis what participants\\nthought they were testing\\nin Milgram&#39;s famous learning\\nand punishment experiment\\nthat you&#39;ve probably heard about\\nif you&#39;re a psychology student.\\nThe story goes that participants\\nwere prepared to give\\nwhat they believed to be fatal\\nelectric shocks to a fellow participant\\nwhen they got a question wrong,\\njust because someone\\nin a white coat told them to.\\nBut this story is a myth\\nfor three reasons.\\nFirstly and most crucially, the lab coat\\nwasn&#39;t white, it was in fact grey.\\nSecondly, the participants\\nwere told before the study\\nand reminded any time\\nthey raised a concern,\\nthat although the shocks were painful,\\nthey were not fatal\\nand indeed caused\\nno permanent damage whatsoever.\\nAnd thirdly, participants\\ndidn&#39;t give the shocks\\njust because someone\\nin the coat told them to.\\nWhen they were interviewed\\nafter the study,\\nall the participants said\\nthat they firmly believed\\nthat the learning and punishment study\\nserved a worthy scientific purpose\\nwhich would have\\nenduring gains for science\\nas opposed to the momentary nonfatal\\ndiscomfort caused to the participants.\\nOkay, so I&#39;ve been talking\\nfor about 12 minutes now,\\nand you&#39;ve probably been \\nsitting there listening to me,\\nanalyzing my speech patterns \\nand body language\\nand trying to work out if you should\\ntake any notice of what I&#39;m saying,\\nwhether I&#39;m telling the truth\\nor whether I&#39;m lying,\\nbut if so you&#39;ve\\nprobably completely failed,\\nbecause although we all think\\nwe can catch a liar\\nfrom their body language\\nand speech patterns,\\nhundreds of psychological tests\\nover the years have shown\\nthat all of us, including\\npolice officers and detectives,\\nare basically at chance when it comes\\nto detecting lies from body language\\nand verbal patterns.\\n\\nInterestingly, there is one exception:\\nTV appeals for missing relatives.\\nIt&#39;s quite easy to predict\\nwhen the relatives are missing\\nand when the appealers have in fact\\nmurdered the relatives themselves.\\nSo hoax appealers are more likely\\nto shake their heads, to look away,\\nand to make errors in their speech,\\nwhereas genuine appealers are more likely\\nto express hope that the person\\nwill return safely\\nand to avoid brutal language.\\nSo, for example, they might say\\n&quot;taken from us&quot; rather than &quot;killed.&quot;\\nSpeaking of which,\\nit&#39;s about time I killed this talk,\\nbut before I do, I just want \\nto give you in 30 seconds\\nthe overarching myth of psychology.\\nSo the myth is that psychology is just\\na collection of interesting theories,\\nall of which say something useful\\nand all of which have something to offer.\\nWhat I hope to have shown you\\nin the past few minutes\\nis that this isn&#39;t true.\\nWhat we need to do is assess\\npsychological theories\\nby seeing what predictions they make,\\nwhether that is that listening to Mozart\\nmakes you smarter,\\nthat you learn better when information is\\npresented in your preferred learning style\\nor whatever it is, all of these\\nare testable empirical predictions,\\nand the only way we can make progress\\nis to test these predictions\\nagainst the data\\nin tightly controlled\\nexperimental studies.\\nAnd it&#39;s only by doing so\\nthat we can hope to discover\\nwhich of these theories\\nare well supported,\\nand which, like all the ones\\nI&#39;ve told you about today, are myths.\\nThank you.\\n\\n(Applause)\\n\\n'"

right-handers,\\nso a grain of truth in the idea\\nof the creative left-hander,\\nbut not much.\\nA related myth that you\\'ve\\nprobably heard of\\nis that we only use\\n10 percent of our brains.\\nThis is, again, a complete myth.\\nNearly everything that we do,\\neven the most mundane thing,\\nuses nearly all of our brains.\\nThat said, it is of course true\\nthat most of us don\\'t use our brainpower\\nquite as well as we could.\\nSo what could we do\\nto boost our brainpower?\\nMaybe we could listen\\nto a nice bit of Mozart.\\nHave you heard of the idea\\nof the Mozart effect?\\nSo the idea is that listening \\nto Mozart makes you smarter\\nand improves your \\nperformance on I.Q. tests.\\nNow again, what\\'s interesting\\nabout this myth\\nis that although it\\'s basically a myth,\\nthere is a grain of truth to it.\\nSo the original study found that\\nparticipants who were played\\nMozart music for a few minutes\\ndid better on a subsequent I.Q. test\\nthan participants who simply\\nsat in silence.\\nBut a follow-up study recruited\\nsome people who liked Mozart music\\nand then another group of people\\nwho were fans of \\nthe horror stories of Stephen King.\\nAnd they played the people\\nthe music or the stories.\\nThe people who preferred\\nMozart music to the stories\\ngot a bigger I.Q. boost\\nfrom the Mozart than the stories,\\nbut the people who preferred\\nthe stories to the Mozart music\\ngot a bigger I.Q. boost\\nfrom listening to the Stephen King stories\\nthan the Mozart music.\\nSo the truth is that listening\\nto something that you enjoy\\nperks you up a bit\\nand gives you a temporary I.Q. boost\\non a narrow range of tasks.\\nThere\\'s no suggestion that\\nlistening to Mozart,\\nor indeed Stephen King stories,\\nis going to make you any smarter\\nin the long run.\\nAnother version of the Mozart myth\\nis that listening to Mozart can make you\\nnot only cleverer but healthier, too.\\nUnfortunately, this doesn\\'t\\nseem to be true\\nof someone who listened\\nto the music of Mozart almost every day,\\nMozart himself,\\nwho suffered from gonorrhea,\\nsmallpox, arthritis,\\nand, what most people think eventually\\nkilled him in the end, syphilis.\\nThis suggests that Mozart\\nshould have bit more careful, perhaps,\\nwhen choosing his sexual partners.\\nBut how do we choose a partner?\\nSo a myth that I have to say\\nis sometimes spread a bit by sociologists\\nis that our preferences in a romantic \\npartner are a product of our culture,\\nthat they\\'re very culturally specific.\\nBut in fact, the data don\\'t back this up.\\nA famous study surveyed people from\\n[37] different cultures across the globe,\\nfrom Americans to Zulus,\\non what they look for in a partner.\\nAnd in every single culture\\nacross the globe,\\nmen placed more value\\non physical attractiveness in a partner\\nthan did women,\\nand in every single culture, too,\\nwomen placed more importance than did men\\non ambition and high earning power.\\nIn every culture, too,\\nmen preferred women\\nwho were younger than themselves,\\nan average of, I think it was 2.66 years,\\nand in every culture, too,\\nwomen preferred men\\nwho were older than them,\\nso an average of 3.42 years,\\nwhich is why we\\'ve got here\\n\"Everybody needs a Sugar Daddy.\"\\nSo moving on from trying\\nto score with a partner\\nto trying to score in basketball\\nor football or whatever your sport is.\\nThe myth here is that sportsmen go through\\nhot-hand streaks, Americans call them,\\nor purple patches,\\nwe sometimes say in England,\\nwhere they just can\\'t miss,\\nlike this guy here.\\nBut in fact, what happens is that\\nif you analyze the pattern\\nof hits and misses statistically,\\nit turns out that it\\'s\\nnearly always at random.\\nYour brain creates patterns\\nfrom the randomness.\\nIf you toss a coin,\\na streak of heads or tails is going \\nto come out somewhere in the randomness,\\nand because the brain likes to see\\npatterns where there are none,\\nwe look at these streaks\\nand attribute meanings to them\\nand say, \"Yeah he\\'s really on form today,\"\\nwhereas actually you would\\nget the same pattern\\nif you were just getting\\nhits and misses at random.\\nSo an exception to this, however,\\nis penalty shootouts.\\nA recent study looking\\nat penalty shootouts in football\\nshows that players who represent countries\\nwith a very bad record\\nin penalty shootouts,\\nlike, for example, England,\\ntend to be quicker to take their shots\\nthan countries with a better record,\\nand presumably as a result,\\nthey\\'re more likely to miss.\\nWhich raises the question\\nof if there\\'s any way that we\\ncould improve people\\'s performance.\\nAnd one thing you might think about doing\\nis punishing people for their misses\\nand seeing if that improves them.\\nThis idea, the effect that punishment\\ncan improve performance,\\nis what participants\\nthought they were testing\\nin Milgram\\'s famous learning\\nand punishment experiment\\nthat you\\'ve probably heard about\\nif you\\'re a psychology student.\\nThe story goes that participants\\nwere prepared to give\\nwhat they believed to be fatal\\nelectric shocks to a fellow participant\\nwhen they got a question wrong,\\njust because someone\\nin a white coat told them to.\\nBut this story is a myth\\nfor three reasons.\\nFirstly and most crucially, the lab coat\\nwasn\\'t white, it was in fact grey.\\nSecondly, the participants\\nwere told before the study\\nand reminded any time\\nthey raised a concern,\\nthat although the shocks were painful,\\nthey were not fatal\\nand indeed caused\\nno permanent damage whatsoever.\\nAnd thirdly, participants\\ndidn\\'t give the shocks\\njust because someone\\nin the coat told them to.\\nWhen they were interviewed\\nafter the study,\\nall the participants said\\nthat they firmly believed\\nthat the learning and punishment study\\nserved a worthy scientific purpose\\nwhich would have\\nenduring gains for science\\nas opposed to the momentary nonfatal\\ndiscomfort caused to the participants.\\nOkay, so I\\'ve been talking\\nfor about 12 minutes now,\\nand you\\'ve probably been \\nsitting there listening to me,\\nanalyzing my speech patterns \\nand body language\\nand trying to work out if you should\\ntake any notice of what I\\'m saying,\\nwhether I\\'m telling the truth\\nor whether I\\'m lying,\\nbut if so you\\'ve\\nprobably completely failed,\\nbecause although we all think\\nwe can catch a liar\\nfrom their body language\\nand speech patterns,\\nhundreds of psychological tests\\nover the years have shown\\nthat all of us, including\\npolice officers and detectives,\\nare basically at chance when it comes\\nto detecting lies from body language\\nand verbal patterns.\\nInterestingly, there is one exception:\\nTV appeals for missing relatives.\\nIt\\'s quite easy to predict\\nwhen the relatives are missing\\nand when the appealers have in fact\\nmurdered the relatives themselves.\\nSo hoax appealers are more likely\\nto shake their heads, to look away,\\nand to make errors in their speech,\\nwhereas genuine appealers are more likely\\nto express hope that the person\\nwill return safely\\nand to avoid brutal language.\\nSo, for example, they might say\\n\"taken from us\" rather than \"killed.\"\\nSpeaking of which,\\nit\\'s about time I killed this talk,\\nbut before I do, I just want \\nto give you in 30 seconds\\nthe overarching myth of psychology.\\nSo the myth is that psychology is just\\na collection of interesting theories,\\nall of which say something useful\\nand all of which have something to offer.\\nWhat I hope to have shown you\\nin the past few minutes\\nis that this isn\\'t true.\\nWhat we need to do is assess\\npsychological theories\\nby seeing what predictions they make,\\nwhether that is that listening to Mozart\\nmakes you smarter,\\nthat you learn better when information is\\npresented in your preferred learning style\\nor whatever it is, all of these\\nare testable empirical predictions,\\nand the only way we can make progress\\nis to test these predictions\\nagainst the data\\nin tightly controlled\\nexperimental studies.\\nAnd it\\'s only by doing so\\nthat we can hope to discover\\nwhich of these theories\\nare well supported,\\nand which, like all the ones\\nI\\'ve told you about today, are myths.\\nThank you.\\n(Applause)'"

       "'You\\'ve heard of your I.Q.,your general intelligence,but what\\'s your Psy-Q?How much do you knowabout what makes you tick,and how good are youat predicting other people\\'s behavioror even your own?And how much of what you think you knowabout psychology is wrong?Let\\'s find out by counting downthe top 10 myths of psychology.You\\'ve probably heard it saidthat when it comes to their psychology,it\\'s almost as if men are from Marsand women are from Venus.But how differentare men and women really?To find out, let\\'s startby looking at somethingon which men and women really do differand plotting some psychologicalgender differences on the same scale.One thing men and womendo really differ onis how far they can throw a ball.So if we look at the data for men here,we see what is calleda normal distribution curve.A few men can throw a ball really far,and a few men not far at all,but most a kind of average distance.And women sharethe same distribution as well,but actually there\\'squite a big difference.In fact, the average mancan throw a ball furtherthan about 98 percent of all women.So now let\\'s look at whatsome psychological gender differenceslook like on the same standardized scale.Any psychologist will tell youthat men are betterat spatial awareness than women --so things like map-reading, for example -- and it\\'s true,but let\\'s have a lookat the size of this difference.It\\'s tiny; the lines are so closetogether they almost overlap.In fact, the average woman is betterthan 33 percent of all men,and of course, if that was 50 percent,then the two genderswould be exactly equal.It\\'s worth bearing in mind that thisdifference and the next one I\\'ll show youare pretty much the biggestpsychological gender differencesever discovered in psychology.So here\\'s the next one.Any psychologist will tell youthat women are betterwith language and grammar than men.So here\\'s performanceon the standardized grammar test.There go the women. There go the men.Again, yes, women are better on average,but the lines are so closethat 33 percent of menare better than the average woman,and again, if it was 50 percent,that would representcomplete gender equality.So it\\'s not reallya case of Mars and Venus.It\\'s more a case of, if anything,Mars and Snickers:basically the same, but one\\'s maybe slightly nuttier than the other.I won\\'t say which.Now we\\'ve got you warmed up.Let\\'s psychoanalyze you usingthe famous Rorschach inkblot test.So you can probably see two, I dunno,two bears or two people or something.But what do you think they\\'re doing?Put your hand up if you thinkthey\\'re saying hello.Not many people. Okay.Put your hands up if you thinkthey are high-fiving.Okay. What if you think they\\'re fighting?Only a few people there.Okay, so if you think they\\'resaying hello or high-fiving,then that means you\\'re a friendly person.If you think they\\'re fighting,you\\'re a bit more of a nasty, aggressive person.Are you a lover or a fighter, basically.What about this one?This isn\\'t really a voting one, so on three everyone shout out what you see.One, two, three.(Audience shouting)I heard hamster. Who said hamster?That was very worrying.A guy there said hamster.Well, you should seesome kind of two-legged animal here,and then the mirror image of them there.If you didn\\'t, then this meansthat you have difficultyprocessing complex situationswhere there\\'s a lot going on.Except, of course,it doesn\\'t mean that at all.Rorschach inkblot testshave basically no validitywhen it comes to diagnosingpeople\\'s personalityand are not usedby modern-day psychologists.In fact, one recent study foundthat when you do tryto diagnose people\\'s personalitiesusing Rorschach inkblot tests,schizophrenia was diagnosedin about one sixth of apparentlyperfectly normal participants.So if you didn\\'t do that well on this,maybe you are nota very visual type of person.So let\\'s do anotherquick quiz to find out.When making a cake, do you prefer to --so hands up for each one again --do you prefer to usea recipe book with pictures?Yeah, a few people.Have a friend talk you through?Or have a go, making it upas you go along?Quite a few people there.Okay, so if you said A,then this means that youare a visual learnerand you learn best when informationis presented in a visual style.If you said B, it meansyou\\'re an auditory learner,that you learn best when informationis presented to you in an auditory format.And if you said C, it meansthat you\\'re a kinesthetic learner,that you learn best when you get stuck inand do things with your hands.Except, of course,as you\\'ve probably guessed,that it doesn\\'t, becausethe whole thing is a complete myth.Learning styles are made up and are not supported by scientific evidence.So we know this because intightly controlled experimental studies,when learners are given material to learneither in their preferred styleor an opposite style,it makes no difference at all to theamount of information that they retain.And if you think about itfor just a second,it\\'s just obviousthat this has to be true.It\\'s obvious thatthe best presentation formatdepends not on you,but on what you\\'re trying to learn.Could you learn to drive a car,for example,just by listening to someonetelling you what to dowith no kinesthetic experience?Could you solve simultaneous equationsby talking them through in your headand without writing them down?Could you revise for your architecture examsusing interpretive danceif you\\'re a kinesthetic learner?No. What you need to do is match the material to be learnedto the presentation format, not you.I know many of you are A-level studentsthat will have recently gottenyour GCSE results.And if you didn\\'t quite getwhat you were hoping for,then you can\\'t really blameyour learning style,but one thing that you might wantto think about blaming is your genes.So what this is all about is arecent study at University College Londonfound that 58 percent of the variationbetween different studentsand their GCSE resultswas down to genetic factors.That sounds like a very precise figure,so how can we tell?Well, when we want to unpackthe relative contributionsof genes and the environment,what we can do is do a twin study.So identical twins share100 percent of their environmentand 100 percent of their genes,whereas non-identical twinsshare 100 percent of their environment,but just like any brother and sister,share only 50 percent of their genes.So by comparing how similarGCSE results are in identical twinsversus non-identical twins,and doing some clever math,we can an idea of how much variationand performance is due to the environmentand how much is due to genes.And it turns out that it\\'sabout 58 percent due to genes.So this isn\\'t to undermine the hard workthat you and your teachers here put in.If you didn\\'t quite get the GCSE resultsthat you were hoping for,then you can always try blamingyour parents, or at least their genes.One thing that you shouldn\\'t blameis being a left-brainedor right-brained learner,because again, this is a myth.So the myth here is thatthe left brain is logical,it\\'s good with equations like this,and the right brain is more creative,so the right brain is better at music.But again, this is a mythbecause nearly everything that you doinvolves nearly all partsof your brain talking together,even just the most mundane thinglike having a normal conversation.However, perhaps one reasonwhy this myth has survivedis that there isa slight grain of truth to it.So a related version of the mythis that left-handed people aremore creative than right-handed people,which kind of makes sense becauseyour brain controls the opposite hands,so left-handed people,the right side of the brainis slightly more activethan the left-hand side of the brain,and the idea is the right-hand sideis more creative.Now, it isn\\'t true per sethat left-handed people are more creativethan right-handed people.What is true that ambidextrous people,or people who use both handsfor different tasks,are more creative thinkersthan one-handed people,because being ambidextrous involveshaving both sides of the braintalk to each other a lot,which seems to be involvedin creating flexible thinking.The myth of the creative left-handerarises from the factthat being ambidextrousis more common amongst left-handers than right-handers,so a grain of truth in the ideaof the creative left-hander,but not much.A related myth that you\\'veprobably heard ofis that we only use10 percent of our brains.This is, again, a complete myth.Nearly everything that we do,even the most mundane thing,uses nearly all of our brains.That said, it is of course truethat most of us don\\'t use our brainpowerquite as well as we could.So what could we doto boost our brainpower?Maybe we could listento a nice bit of Mozart.Have you heard of the ideaof the Mozart effect?So the idea is that listening to Mozart makes you smarterand improves your performance on I.Q. tests.Now again, what\\'s interestingabout this mythis that although it\\'s basically a myth,there is a grain of truth to it.So the original study found thatparticipants who were playedMozart music for a few minutesdid better on a subsequent I.Q. testthan participants who simplysat in silence.But a follow-up study recruitedsome people who liked Mozart musicand then another group of peoplewho were fans of the horror stories of Stephen King.And they played the peoplethe music or the stories.The people who preferredMozart music to the storiesgot a bigger I.Q. boostfrom the Mozart than the stories,but the people who preferredthe stories to the Mozart musicgot a bigger I.Q. boostfrom listening to the Stephen King storiesthan the Mozart music.So the truth is that listeningto something that you enjoyperks you up a bitand gives you a temporary I.Q. booston a narrow range of tasks.There\\'s no suggestion thatlistening to Mozart,or indeed Stephen King stories,is going to make you any smarterin the long run.Another version of the Mozart mythis that listening to Mozart can make younot only cleverer but healthier, too.Unfortunately, this doesn\\'tseem to be trueof someone who listenedto the music of Mozart almost every day,Mozart himself,who suffered from gonorrhea,smallpox, arthritis,and, what most people think eventuallykilled him in the end, syphilis.This suggests that Mozartshould have bit more careful, perhaps,when choosing his sexual partners.But how do we choose a partner?So a myth that I have to sayis sometimes spread a bit by sociologistsis that our preferences in a romantic partner are a product of our culture,that they\\'re very culturally specific.But in fact, the data don\\'t back this up.A famous study surveyed people from[37] different cultures across the globe,from Americans to Zulus,on what they look for in a partner.And in every single cultureacross the globe,men placed more valueon physical attractiveness in a partnerthan did women,and in every single culture, too,women placed more importance than did menon ambition and high earning power.In every culture, too,men preferred womenwho were younger than themselves,an average of, I think it was 2.66 years,and in every culture, too,women preferred menwho were older than them,so an average of 3.42 years,which is why we\\'ve got here\"Everybody needs a Sugar Daddy.\"So moving on from tryingto score with a partnerto trying to score in basketballor football or whatever your sport is.The myth here is that sportsmen go throughhot-hand streaks, Americans call them,or purple patches,we sometimes say in England,where they just can\\'t miss,like this guy here.But in fact, what happens is thatif you analyze the patternof hits and misses statistically,it turns out that it\\'snearly always at random.Your brain creates patternsfrom the randomness.If you toss a coin,a streak of heads or tails is going to come out somewhere in the randomness,and because the brain likes to seepatterns where there are none,we look at these streaksand attribute meanings to themand say, \"Yeah he\\'s really on form today,\"whereas actually you wouldget the same patternif you were just gettinghits and misses at random.So an exception to this, however,is penalty shootouts.A recent study lookingat penalty shootouts in footballshows that players who represent countrieswith a very bad recordin penalty shootouts,like, for example, England,tend to be quicker to take their shotsthan countries with a better record,and presumably as a result,they\\'re more likely to miss.Which raises the questionof if there\\'s any way that wecould improve people\\'s performance.And one thing you
